ðŸŽ¯ Our class was recently introduced to APIs and we've been tasked with building a simple app with an API.

ðŸ§© View a countdown to the next MCU release, then choose an MCU movie to view more details.

ðŸ“œ Page displays
- countdown to next MCU release
- movie title
- movie poster
- director
<!-- - phase number within the MCU
- number of post credit scenes -->
- release date
- movie synopsis
<!-- - playable trailer
- link to IMDB page -->

ðŸ¤– I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.
