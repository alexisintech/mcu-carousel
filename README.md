ðŸŽ¯ Our class was recently introduced to APIs and we've been tasked with building a simple app with an API.

ðŸ”¨ Choose an MCU movie by its number in release date order.

ðŸ“œ Page displays
- movie title
- movie poster
- director
- phase number within the MCU
- number of post credit scenes
- release date
- playable trailer
- link to IMDB page

ðŸ¤– I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.
